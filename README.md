Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Joy and I am happy to see you on my github page ! 

Strongly convinced that tech and AI is the future, after years working in the fashion industry, I was very curious to learn about it and started studying UX/UI design and then Fullstack web development, to be part of it ! 
I ended it up loving it and loving to mix my knowledge in design with tech. 

I've gratuated from Le Wagon bootcamp in March 2023 ðŸŽ“ and I'm looking forward to working in an amazing company that is:

Young and active
Tech-lover
Turned on excellence !

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on personal projects like improving my skills by testing new features, giving design advices to peopl I know.


â€™m currently working on personal tech projects: continuing the development of my bootcamp project, recreating amazing features seen online, or helping friends with their webapps / websites!
